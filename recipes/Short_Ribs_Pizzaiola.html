    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (28 ounce) can San Marzano plum tomatoes</li>
        <li>6 beef short ribs (3 pounds total)</li>
        <li>3 teaspoons kosher salt, plus more to taste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>10 large brown mushrooms, halved</li>
        <li>1 yellow onion, diced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon red chili flakes</li>
        <li>8 cloves garlic, finely minced</li>
        <li>1/2 cup white wine</li>
        <li>1 cup chicken or beef broth</li>
        <li>1 large red bell pepper, diced</li>
        <li>1/2 cup fresh basil leaves to tear and serve on top</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Transfer San Marzano tomatoes into a mixing bowl, and use your hand to crush into a fine pur√©e. Set aside until needed.</li>
        <li>Season short ribs with salt on all sides.</li>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a Dutch oven over high heat, and brown short ribs very well on all sides, about 8 minutes. Turn off heat, remove short ribs to a plate, and set aside.</li>
        <li>Add mushrooms, along with a pinch of salt, and turn heat to medium-high. Use tongs to turn each mushroom onto a flat side down, and cook until golden brown, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add onion and cook, stirring, until they begin to turn translucent, 3 to 5 minutes. Add oregano, black pepper, and chili flakes, and cook, stirring, for about 1 minute. Add garlic; cook for 1 minute more.
</li>
        <li>Pour in white wine, and stir to deglaze the bottom of the pot. Add tomatoes and broth. Turn heat up to high and bring to simmer. Stir in the diced bell pepper, and transfer short ribs back in. </li>
        <li>Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer gently until meat is very tender when pierced with a fork, 3 to 4 hours. About 2 hours into the cooking time, turn short ribs over.</li>
        <li>When short ribs are tender, remove to a plate; set aside. Turn heat up to medium-high, and boil  sauce for about 10 minutes, or until it reduces to your desired thickness. While reducing, excess fact can be skimmed off the top. Taste; season with salt and pepper if needed.

</li>
        <li>Transfer short ribs back into sauce. reduce heat to low, and simmer, basting occasionally with sauce, until heated through, about 10 minutes. Serve with fresh basil.</li>
